Drawing App

This code is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of a simple drawing application that allows the user to draw on a canvas using different colors and sizes.

The HTML code defines the basic structure of the application, including a canvas element for drawing, a toolbox section for selecting colors and sizes, and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

The CSS code defines the appearance of the application, including the font, background color, and styles for the canvas and toolbox elements.

The JavaScript code provides the interactivity of the application. It creates references to various elements on the page, such as the canvas and the toolbox buttons, and defines event listeners to respond to user actions, such as mouse clicks and movements. It also defines functions to draw circles and lines on the canvas, update the size and color of the drawing tool, and clear the canvas.

Overall, this code creates a simple drawing application that allows the user to create art using a mouse or touch input.
